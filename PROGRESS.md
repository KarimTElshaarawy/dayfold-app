# PROGRESS

Last updated: 2026-10-27. Nothing here depends on chat memory.

## 1. Goal
Dayfold, a study planner (personal project of the owner). Two codebases:
- Web app (self-hosted): /home/user/study-planner, branch claude/wizardly-davinci-derplc. Fastify 5 + better-sqlite3 + React 19 PWA, deterministic planner, daily email (Resend, else outbox/). Pushed. Definition of done met (all gates green, Opus final audit fixed).
- Mobile app (fully on-device, iOS + Android): /home/user/dayfold-app, remote dayfold-app (same owner), branch main. Capacitor 7 wrapper, no server, no email, local notifications. Built only in GitHub Actions workflow "Build apps": unsigned Dayfold.ipa (installed with Sideloadly, free Apple ID, user is on Windows ARM + WSL, no Mac) and Dayfold.apk.
Definition of done for the current phase: the newest mobile features (session reminders, bulk import of classes and topics, accent colors, native keyboard) pass all local gates, a CI build is green, and the user confirms them on the phone.

## 2. Decisions and reasons
- Mobile data mode fully on-device, separate repo (user chose both).
- PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (user wants free use, nobody may profit). Not OSI open source. GPL rejected because it allows selling.
- Name Dayfold (user rejected "Cadence" over trademark worry; wants unique, simple, memorable).
- Red default accent (user likes red), now user-changeable: 8 presets + custom picker, WCAG contrast adjusted per theme.
- Keyboard: hide iOS accessory bar, theme-matched, no autocorrect/suggestions, Done key, tap-away dismiss, because user said it must feel like an app, not a web form.
- Public repo must contain ZERO personal data (no email, student ID, real exams, secrets). Resend key is private; installers use their own. Real exams live only in gitignored seed/personal.json and .env.
- Native keyboard resize left at default (Capacitor config string 'native' failed typing).
- Android uses a committed public debug keystore (optional release signing via secrets).
- Toast centering via margins, not transform, because Motion overrides transforms.

## 3. My rules and preferences
- Ask questions only once; after that never ask the user anything again (original brief).
- No em dashes in my writing. No hard-coded values; read settings at runtime. Make no mistakes.
- Opus must review everything and loop until clean, but the user rejected the Agent call twice: confirm before relaunching Opus.
- Never delete, rename or revert files or code when compacting.
- Never repeat secret values.

## 4. Current state
Mobile repo last pushed 5578437 (courses+names+topics import; 39 unit tests, e2e, tsc, eslint, build green); before that 6bd3eed (8b5b2a5 keyboard, 2a62407 features). Web repo last 283ec91 (toast fix). Both working trees clean at resume.
Key mobile files: src/device/{storage,repo,prefs,router,service,reminders,notifications,importers,index}.ts, src/lib/{api,accent,keyboard,statusBar,hooks}.ts, src/main.tsx, src/pages/Settings.tsx, src/components/{BulkImportSheet,Sheet,Toast,StartupError,UnreadableBanner}.tsx, scripts/{config,patch-ios,patch-android,make-assets}.mjs, .github/workflows/build.yml, tests/{helpers,device,native,features}.test.ts, tests/e2e/app.spec.ts.
Last known results: mobile 38 unit tests, 1 e2e, tsc and eslint clean. Web 69 unit/API, 11 e2e, simulation 0 violations, secret scan clean, Lighthouse 96-100.

## 5. Unresolved errors and known failures
- None open locally. Past: Playwright pinned to 1.63.0; git push printed "fatal: expected 'acknowledgments', received 'packfile'" but the branch landed.
- Unverified: CI builds for the newest commits, real iPhone keyboard behavior, Sideloadly on Windows ARM, Docker image never built.

## 6. Ordered TODO
1. DONE 2026-10-27: re-verified both repos (mobile 39 unit + e2e; web typecheck, lint, 69 tests, simulate 0 violations, scan clean). Added course+name+topic CSV import (Settings > Data > Import courses and topics).
1a. DONE: Opus review of the newest batch found 13 issues, all fixed (DST reminder times, Enter submits forms, headerless 3-col topics, end<=start commitments, ICS UTC weekday shift/TZID/DURATION/UNTIL, accent ink contrast on tint, sheet state reset, Android USE_EXACT_ALARM, serialized sync + sync on pause, restore applies accent, preview caps, debounced color picker). 45 unit tests, e2e, tsc, eslint, build green. Not yet re-reviewed by Opus.
1c. DONE 2026-10-28: user bugs fixed (copy backup lost to keyboard close; tab bar over keyboard; typed times lost on iOS), spinning-logo start screen, page/tab/check animations. Opus reviewed (11 findings, all fixed). New e2e tests emulate the phone keyboard and were shown to fail on the old behavior. CI test job now runs the e2e tests. 48 unit, 3 e2e green.
1d. DONE 2026-10-28: second Opus pass fixed (CI e2e now pinned to a fixed date and UTC, meal rename lost on Add, Sheet stealing focus on data refresh, Add topic keeps keyboard, boot failure shows StartupError, splash accent from storage, label captions no longer activate buttons, double-submit guards). 48 unit, 4 e2e green. Third Opus pass fixed: rejected settings roll back (refetch + remount), accent not overwritten at launch, Add topic keeps keyboard on Android and Enter, FieldGroup a11y, Reset clears look prefs. 48 unit, 5 e2e green. The last small delta (rollback remount) was tested but not re-reviewed by Opus.
1e. DONE 2026-10-28: bigger start-up animation (ring draws, dot pops and orbits, glow, name, progress bar, eased exit; ~2.2 s cold start, skipped with reduced motion). CI e2e failure was a timing bug in my meals test (fixed); user must start a NEW Build apps run (not Re-run) on the latest main.
1f. DONE 2026-10-28: swipe left/right between tabs (src/lib/swipe.ts, slide-in animation, e2e with CDP touch). Splash + swipe committed locally; Opus review then push.
1b. NEXT ACTION: user re-runs Build apps and reinstalls; then ask about the Opus review.
2. User re-runs Actions > Build apps and reinstalls Dayfold.ipa via Sideloadly.
3. Ask the user whether to run the Opus review of the newest batch, loop until clean.
4. Optional offers: Raspberry Pi guide, Fly.io config, port mobile features to web, trademark check, store launch.
